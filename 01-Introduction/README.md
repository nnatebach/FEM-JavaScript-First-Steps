===========================

#### 1. About the course
- Taking our *first step* is an infinite journey<br>
    - Provide an accessible solid foundations for all-level learners.
    - whether you are coming from another program languages or you are brand new in programming.
- Hands-on projects
- *Just-in-time* vs. *just-in-case* learning
    - *just-in-case*: You learned something interesting but there is a small chance that someone will ever ask you about that knowledge.
    - *just-in-time*: When you are trying to do something and you want to *learn what you need* at that point in time in order to do that thing.

**Goal:** We are going to focus more on *just-in-time* learning, we are going to try to focus on the practical needs that we have and learning things as we need them.

- The relationship between HTML, CSS, JS
    - Explanation 1:
        - HTML: The noun
        - CSS: The adjective

    - Explanation 2 (from Anjana):
    <a href="https://anjana.dev/javascript-first-steps/1-slides.html#/3/5"><img src="html-css-js-relationship.jpg"></a>
        - HTML: Actors on stage, props, context
        - CSS: Costumes, set design, lighting, style
        - JS: Choreography, dancing, moving
- Places to run JavaScript (a little recap)
    - The browser's JS console
    - Local text file in editor, e.g. TextEditor, VSCode
    - Online playground e.g. CodePen, CodeSandbox
